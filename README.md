Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the process of designing,developing and maintaing software.
In the technology world software engineering is used to:
design applications
test and fix bugs
write code to fix problems in the world



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Early days 1940s-1960s
Characterised by huge computer that was very complex and required a lot of labour.
The software crisis stage 1960s-1980s
As many people started to embrace software engineering the shortage of developers could be felt and the high demand could not be met by the limited budget.
There were many mistakes and bugs
The first NATO engineering confrence is held,structured programming and object oriented programming are developed
1990s-to present
The agile manifesto is released in 1995
Methodoligies like scrum,kanban and lean are developed.
The future
AI, Cloud computing are embraced



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Idea generation-come up with an idea from the problems that face society
Requirement analysis-establish what your application requires
product design-work around how you can solve the identified problem using an application
product development-Do the actual coding
intergration and testing-check whether the application can work in the real world
deployment-roll out the application
maintenance-Keep making it better

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is rigid while agile is flexible.Waterfall is linear ans sequencial approach while agile focuses on small deliveries while working on bettering through feedback.
Agile methodology is ideal for evolving projects,startups or innovative products.
Waterfall works well in projects that have well defined requirements like government contracts.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer designs and builds the software,project manager is responsible for  planning,execution and control of project Quality assurance manager is responsible for detecting issues with the developed project

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development Environment helps programmers to develope softwares well. It makes their work easier as it combines some functions like building testing,editing and packaging.Examples of IDEs ae like microsoft visual studio and eclipse.
Version control systems on the other hand are systems that help software developer to maintain their software overtime as changes occur. Examples of SCV is Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid technological advancement
Subjective opinions regarding quality of their work


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models. 
prompt engineering refers to crafting questions to grt quality responses from AI models.
Prompt engineering helps in getting clear responses from AI models


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
